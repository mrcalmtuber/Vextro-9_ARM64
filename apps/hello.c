 * outside itself, so an application that wanted anti-aliased text used to
 * have to contain a TrueType rasteriser. This structure is the whole of
 * the alternative: a tag the loader searches the data segment for, a
 * count, and names with their addresses left zero. The loader fills them
 * in before the entry point runs.
 *
 * `volatile` so the compiler cannot decide the zeroes are the final word
 * and fold the calls away — the addresses are written by something it
 * cannot see.
