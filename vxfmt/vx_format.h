/*
 * .vx — a minimal executable container for x86_64.
 *
 * The whole format is one fixed header followed by two images:
 *
 *      offset 0        vx_header_t                    (80 bytes)
 *      text_off        text image      -> mapped R-X
 *      data_off        data image      -> mapped RW-, then bss_size
 *                                         zero bytes appended
 *
 * Design rules, all enforced by vx_validate():
 *
 *   - Every field after the magic is uint64_t, and a uint32_t version
 *     pads the 4-byte magic out to 8, so no field straddles an 8-byte
 *     boundary and the header can be read straight out of a mapping
 *     with no unaligned access on any x86_64 ABI.
 *
 *   - text_vaddr and data_vaddr are page aligned and the data segment
 *     starts on a page after the last text page.  Without that a loader
 *     could not mprotect() the two segments differently: protection has
 *     page granularity, so a shared page would have to be RWX and the
 *     W^X guarantee would be gone.
 *
 *   - File offsets are congruent to their virtual addresses modulo the
 *     page size, so a loader may mmap() the segments directly from the
 *     file descriptor instead of copying.
 *
 * Images are expected to be position independent (RIP-relative, no
 * relocations): there is no relocation table, so a loader is free to
 * place the image anywhere as long as it preserves the distance between
 * the text and data segments.
 *
 * This header is shared by the host tools and by the Vextro kernel,
 * so it stays freestanding: stdint.h and nothing else.
 */

/*
 * The fourth magic byte is the architecture, and always was — it is 0x64
 * for x86_64 because that is what the format was built for.
 *
 * That makes it the right place to say "aarch64" too, rather than adding
 * a machine field. A new field moves every offset after it and changes
 * the header size, so an old kernel handed a new image would read the
 * entry point out of the middle of something else. Spending the byte
 * that already exists means an x86_64 kernel rejects an aarch64 image
 * with "bad magic - not a .vx image" using the check it already has,
 * and the reverse holds too: a wrong-architecture image fails at the
 * first test rather than at the first instruction.
 */
/*
 * 0x7F leads, the way ELF's does, so that a plain text file can never be
 * mistaken for an executable -- no printable byte sequence starts here.
 * Then the format's name, then the machine, so one glance at a hexdump
 * says both what the file is and what it will run on.

/* ===== imported symbols =====
 *
 * A `.vx` image carries no relocations, which is what lets a loader put
 * it anywhere as long as the text-to-data distance is preserved. That
 * also means it has no way to reference anything outside itself, so every
 * application statically contains whatever it uses — fine for a fractal,
 * expensive for anything that wants the TrueType rasteriser.
 *
 * This is the smallest thing that fixes it without giving up the property
 * that makes the format simple. The application places one initialised
 * structure in its data: a magic word, a count, and that many name/address
 * pairs with the addresses left zero. The loader finds the structure,
 * looks each name up in the kernel's export table, and writes the
 * addresses in. The application then calls through them.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a header field. The header is a fixed eighty bytes
 * with a static assertion on it, `vx_validate` is shared verbatim by the
 * host packer, the kernel loader and the store's download path, and all
 * three would have to change together for a feature none of them need to
 * know about. A self-describing table in the data segment costs an eight
 * byte tag and leaves every existing image byte-for-byte valid.
 *
 * The loader searches for the tag rather than requiring it at a fixed
 * offset, so no linker script has to guarantee placement — which is the
 * kind of requirement that works until someone adds a global.
